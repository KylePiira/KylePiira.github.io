<p>I am a student at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu">University of Massachusetts</a> and the founder of the <a href="https://www.hoxly.com">Hoxly Corporation</a>. While at Hoxly, I've worked on a number of ambitious projects.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.asksteem.com/">AskSteem</a> was a search engine for the STEEM <a href="https://microblog.piira.org/@kyle/101451594045144247">blockchain</a>. During its lifetime it served over a billion queries and generated upwards of $40,000 in API sales.</li>
	<li><a href="https://answers.hoxly.net/">Hoxly Answers</a> is a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1838/">machine learning</a> based question and answer website. It uses a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3215v3.pdf">sequence-to-sequence</a> model with attention that tries to produce questions for which some given text is the answer. The data made available on the site today is taken from select articles of the <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/">English Wikipedia</a>.</li>
	<li>Hoxly News was an algorithmic news site that would rank news articles using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG0fIXfrT9A">PageRank</a> divided by time. It had a relatively short-lived trial run of only one week but produced promising results.</li>
	<li><a href="https://links.hoxly.com">Hoxly Links</a> is a dead link redirection service which automatically redirects links to web pages that no longer exist on the web or have temporarily gone offline to an archived copy.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX57lQSD0ug">Cherry on Top</a> was a <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a> extension that allowed users to input an arbitrary number of Amazon affiliate codes to cycle through whenever they shopped on <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. It was designed to help content creators who used <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">Amazon Affiliates</a> for supplemental revenue. The extension was discontinued over concerns with the <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies/#Associates%20Program%20Participation%20Requirements">Amazon Affiliates Terms of Use</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I primarily have experience with the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python programming language</a> including many of it's most popular libraries and ecosystems such as <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> (namely <a href="http://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>), <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, and <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> (deep learning library). Additionally, the University of Massachusetts uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java programming language</a> in its <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">computer science department</a> thus I am familiar with it as well. I also have broad knowledge of many other technologies not listed here. If you have questions about something specific feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">drop me an email</a>.</p>
