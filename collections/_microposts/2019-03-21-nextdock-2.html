<p>NextDock 2 is a cool project being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nexcomputer/nexdock-2">crowdfunded right now</a>. Basically it is a laptop with no onboard CPU, memory, or disk but it can be connected to any device that offers HDMI out to be used as a monitor (Android Phone, Raspberry Pi, Chromecast, etc.).</p>
<p>If you've ever wanted a portable monitor with built in keyboard and a huge battery then you might wanna check this out.</p>
