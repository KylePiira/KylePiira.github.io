      <h3>Things I want to highlight that aren't important enough to be put on the main blog.</h3>

	<p><b>Apr 22nd, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/04/22/librevox/">permalink</a></p>
	<p>If you like Audiobooks check out <a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a> which offers free public domain audiobooks that you can download. The books tend to be a bit older but at least there is no DRM.

</p>

	<p><b>Apr 14th, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/04/14/rogue-waves-common/">permalink</a></p>
	<p><p>Interesting video about how surprisingly common Rogue waves actually are.</p>

	<p><b>Apr 14th, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/04/14/aurora-update-v2-to-v3/">permalink</a></p>
	<p>For anyone using Aurora store from F-Droid make sure you change to the new <a href="https://f-droid.org/app/com.aurora.store">v3 package</a> which is a separate listing from the previous v2 one.</p>

	<p><b>Apr 9th, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/04/09/khtml/">permalink</a></p>
	<p>It's interesting that most of todays browsers have heritage going back to KHTML (by KDE). Chromium, WebKit, Safari, Edge, Brave, Opera, etc. all have some link to it. The only browser I can think of that doesn't currently have KHTML code in it is Firefox.
</p>

	<p><b>Apr 7th, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/04/07/water-css/">permalink</a></p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/kognise/water.css">Water.css</a> is a neat little stylesheet that you can include on your static HTML documents to make them look a bit more modern. It doesn't have any classes, just the tags.</p>

	<p><b>Apr 2nd, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/04/02/unix-philospophy-video/">permalink</a></p>
	<p><p>Interesting video about the original UNIX philosophy of combining small programs together to complete more complex tasks.</p>

	<p><b>Mar 31st, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/03/31/stackoverflow-april-fools/">permalink</a></p>
	<p><p>StackOverflow has started their April fools joke for this year. They made the site look like something from the early 2000s with gifs and such.</p>

	<p><b>Mar 30th, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/03/30/tor/">permalink</a></p>
	<p><p>Its interesting that Tor nodes are operating at a loss while VPN companies are raking in the cash.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes the Tor network is basically just a decentralized VPN service. Perhaps Tor could offer a paid fast lane (or introduce some way to automatically donate to nodes as you use them) to incentivize nodes to join.</p>
<p>I also think Tor could gain quite a few more users by marketing to folks who are just trying to access websites blocked on their work/school WiFi.</p></p>

	<p><b>Mar 21st, 2019</b> - <a href="/2019/03/21/nextdock-2/">permalink</a></p>
	<p><p>NextDock 2 is a cool project being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nexcomputer/nexdock-2">crowdfunded right now</a>. Basically it is a laptop with no onboard CPU, memory, or disk but it can be connected to any device that offers HDMI out to be used as a monitor (Android Phone, Raspberry Pi, Chromecast, etc.).</p>
<p>If you've ever wanted a portable monitor with built in keyboard and a huge battery then you might wanna check this out.</p></p>
